 * loop if the guard intervened. /profile-completion is the destination for
 * the profile-completion stage — redirecting to it from itself is a no-op.
 *
 * /forgot-password and /reset-password: OTP verification creates a full
 * Supabase session, then the user must finish setting a new password. If
 * authStage is profile_completion, the guard would otherwise yank them off
 * mid-reset. ForgotPassword sets sessionStorage.passwordResetFlow as a
 * belt-and-suspenders signal (also honored below).
 *
 * NOTE: /login and /register are intentionally NOT in this set. If a user
 * reaches them while already authenticated (e.g. the async login callback
 * didn't navigate, or they bookmarked /login), the guard should bounce them
 * to the appropriate page so they are never stranded on an auth page.

 * 2. **Authenticated-on-auth-page redirect**: if an authenticated user is on
 *    /login or /register, redirects them to the appropriate page. This handles
 *    the case where the async login callback's navigate() was silently dropped
 *    by React Router (a known timing issue with navigation from async callbacks
 *    that complete after a state update triggers a re-render).
 *
 * Design constraints:
 *  - Waits for `isInitializing === false` so the store's `authStage` is settled.
 *  - Exempts auth-flow routes (/auth/callback, /add-phone, /profile-completion)
 *    to prevent redirect loops.
 *  - Renders <Outlet /> for everyone except a user who is about to be redirected.
