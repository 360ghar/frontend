# Styling Guide

## SASS Structure
- `public/assets/sass/` - Main SASS directory
  - `abstracts/` - Variables, mixins, functions
  - `base/` - Base styling elements and reset
  - `components/` - Component-specific styles
  - `layout/` - Layout styles (grid, containers)
  - `partials/` - Page-specific styles
    - `home/`, `home-two/`, etc. - Styles for different homepage variations
    - `othersPage/` - Styles for other pages

## CSS Assets
- `public/assets/css/` - Compiled CSS files
- `public/assets/fonts/` - Custom font files
- `public/assets/webfonts/` - Web font files

## Styling Conventions
- Component-specific styles are in corresponding SASS partials
- Global variables defined in `abstracts/` directory
- Responsive design breakpoints managed via mixins
- RTL (Right-to-Left) support in `partials/rtlVersion/`

## Images
- `public/assets/images/` - Image assets
  - Use appropriate subdirectory based on image type (icons, logo, shapes, thumbs)
  - Consider image optimization for production
